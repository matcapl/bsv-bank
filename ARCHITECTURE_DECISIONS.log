## Decision: Validation in Common Library (FINAL)
- Date: 2025-12-03
- Status: COMMITTED - Don't override
- Reason: 77 tests in common cover all validation. 6 services share this.
- Cost of duplication: 6x maintenance burden
- Rollback cost: HIGH (would need to refactor all 5 remaining services)

All validation functions MUST import from `bsv_bank_common::validation`.

No exceptions. Reference this log if tempted to duplicate.
